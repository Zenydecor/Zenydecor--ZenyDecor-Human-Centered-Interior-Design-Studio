# Zenydecor--ZenyDecor-Human-Centered-Interior-Design-Studio
Designing mindful spaces with simplicity, purpose, and technology that respects privacy
📌 About ZenyDecor
ZenyDecor is a Vietnam-based interior design studio focused on creating personalized, minimalist living spaces using a human-centered approach and open technologies. We believe that great design starts with empathy – and every detail in a space should reflect the lifestyle and values of its owner.

ZenyDecor combines modern aesthetics (Zen, Japandi, Scandinavian styles) with sustainable materials and digital workflows that prioritize user privacy. Our remote-first design process allows clients to collaborate from anywhere in the world without compromising their data security.

🛠️ Our Digital Workflow
We integrate design tools and project management systems that are:

✅ Privacy-focused (no third-party data sharing)

✅ Remote-friendly

✅ Customizable to each project

Example tools we use:

Figma for collaborative UI/UX & layout designs

Blender for 3D visualization

Notion (self-hosted) for internal documentation

Secure file-sharing with encrypted storage

We do not require clients to sign in with social media accounts or allow tracking pixels in order to access their project content.
